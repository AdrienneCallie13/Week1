Learning reflection: I have learned more depth about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in first week by completing task 1 to 3.
W3schools website really helps me in learning about basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Task 1: HTML is a mark-up language that determines the structure of web pages at their most basic level. HTML instructs browsers how to process content and deliver it to the viewer using tags and attributes. 
The head section and the body section are the two sections of an HTML document. The head section of the page provides meta-data about the page as well as any internal CSS.
This information is not displayed to readers by the browser. All of the content that will be shown on the front end, such as paragraphs, pictures, and links, is contained in the body section.
