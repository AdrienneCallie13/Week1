Learning reflection: I have learned more depth about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in first week by completing task 1 to 3.
W3schools website really helps me in learning about basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Task 1: I learned about HTML is a mark-up language that determines the structure of web pages at their most basic level. HTML instructs browsers how to process content and deliver it to the viewer using tags and attributes.  

Task 2:
3 types of CSS:
-	Inline: CSS directly in our HTML elements
-	Internal: style element in the head section of the HTML document
-	External: We then write all of our CSS in a separate stylesheet called style.css so that itâ€™s easily manageable.

Task 3: I'm using JavaScript to create and control dynamic website content. For examples: animated graphics, photo slideshows, autocomplete text suggestions, interactive form.

Task 4: On task 4, I was struggled to create a to-do list. I was able to create to do list on HTML but not on JavaScript. Along the week, I challenged myself and learned how to create to-do list using HTML and JavaScript code on Visual Studio Code and familiarise myself with Vue.

Task 4 refinement: After one week of familiarise vue.js, I can finally create simple to-do list using Vue, HTML, and Java Script.
